## 🛡️ TryHackMe: Defensive Security Intro

This room introduced core defensive security concepts like monitoring, detection, and response. I explored how defenders track threats in real time, respond to incidents, and prevent breaches through strategic network visibility.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Learned the difference between Red Team (Offensive) vs. Blue Team (Defensive)
- Practiced thinking like a security analyst monitoring logs and alerts
- Developed an understanding of SIEM tools and how they're used to detect threats
- Gained awareness of threat intelligence and indicators of compromise (IoCs)

This room helped me see how important proactive monitoring is in cybersecurity, and made me excited to explore roles like SOC analyst and threat responder.


📍 **I'll continue to update this file** as I complete the rest of the learning path and begin the “Complete Beginner” and “Jr Penetration Tester” paths.
